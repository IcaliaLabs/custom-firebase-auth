Description:
  With "rails g icalialabs_firebase name" you can generate views and controllers that
  will be used in order to authenticate users with Firebase.

Example:
  bin/rails g icalialabs_firebase views

  This will create a folder named 'firebase' with two partials:
    - app/views/firebase/login.html.erb
    - app/views/firebase/signin.html.erb
